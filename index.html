	  Ionic liquids (ILs) are organic salts that have sufficiently
	  low melting points that, in their pure state, they are
	  liquid around room temperature. We will discuss how ILs can
	  be designed for a variety of important energy-related
	  applications. We will show ILs for gas separations,
	  including removal of CO<sub>2</sub> from post-combustion
	  flue gas, pre-combustion gases, and natural gas.
	</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      We will also discuss the use of ILs for two different types
      of refrigeration systems: IL/water absorption refrigeration
      and CO<sub>2</sub>/IL co-fluid vapor compression
      refrigeration.  Both of these offer environmental advantages
      over conventional technology while improving coefficients of
      performance.  Next, we will show how the structure of the
      anion and cation can improve the "ionicity" of ILs, which is
      important in the use of ILs as electrolytes for lithium-ion
      batteries, dye sensitized solar cells and supercapacitors.

	  The current challenges faced by the pharmaceutical industry
