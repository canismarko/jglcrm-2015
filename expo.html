      The 2015 JGLCRM Regional ACS meeting will likely draw 1000&ndash;1400
      contacts and potential new customers from a wide range of
      industries. At the meeting, there will be an exhibition space to
      display your company’s unique products and interact with the meeting
      attendees. The exhibition is scheduled in four sessions over two days,
      including hours unopposed by the technical programs or social
      events. The exhibition area is centrally located with respect to
      technical meeting rooms, plenary session areas, poster session areas
      and registration, thus ensuring strong traffic flow through the
      exhibits. A series of raffle and other events are planned during the
      exhibition. If you have any special items you would like to donate for
      raffle events or if your company would be interested in sponsoring a
      refreshment break, poster session, social event, awards or plenary
      session, we would appreciate your support and will prominently
      recognize your participation.

Booth space will be allotted in 10’×10’ spaces. Double spaces may be
obtained but they will be limited in number. Each booth will be
equipped with a sign, pipe & drape, a table, chairs, and a
wastebasket.  Additional furniture, electricity, telephone or internet
connections are available on a for-fee basis.

For those companies who cannot, or choose not to, send a
representative, table space service may be provided. Your literature
can be set out at the start of the show and periodically
replenished. Unused literature will not be returned unless special
arrangements are made.

A special area will be designated for academic institutions that wish
to recruit during the undergraduate poster session or during high
school attendance day, and tables will be available at a reduced rate.

Each exhibitor will receive a list of attendees and their purchasing
plans. Commercial exhibitors will receive two registrations, while
academic exhibitors will receive one registration.
