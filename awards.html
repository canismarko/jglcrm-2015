	<h4>Establishment & Support</h4>
	<p>
	  This award was instituted in 2014 by a contribution from
	  Marinda Li Wu out of her Immediate Past ACS President’s
	  budget as part of her presidential initiatives to promote
	  partnering for progress and prosperity. The funds will be
	  evenly distributed at the end of 2014 to all Regional
	  Meeting Boards who wish to participate. It will be up to
	  each Regional Meeting Board how much to fund each P3 Award
	  and whether any of the funds should be used to help support
	  travel if needed.  It is Dr. Wu’s hope that this will be an
	  ongoing award to recognize the importance of partnering and
	  working together towards common goals to advance the global
	  chemistry enterprise.
