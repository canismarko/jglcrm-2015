      Scott E. Denmark was born in New York on 17 June 1953.  He
      obtained an S. B. degree from M.I.T. in 1975 and his graduate
      studies were carried out at the ETH-Z&uuml;rich under the direction
      of Professor Albert Eschenmoser, culminating in a D. Sc. Tech
      degree in 1980. That same year he began his career as assistant
      professor at the University of Illinois.  He was promoted to
      associate professor in 1986, full professor in 1987 and then in
      1991 named the Reynold C. Fuson Professor of Chemistry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Denmark is primarily interested in the invention of
      new synthetic reactions and elucidating the origins of
      stereocontrol in novel, asymmetric reactions. The current
      emphasis in his laboratories focuses on the relationship between
      structure, reactivity and stereoselectivity in a variety of
      organoelement processes. He has pioneered the concept of chiral
      Lewis base activation of Lewis acids for catalysis in main group
      synthetic organic chemistry. His group has also developed
      palladium-catalyzed cross-couplings with organofunctional
      silicon compounds. In addition his research program encompasses
      the development and application of tandem heterodiene
      cycloadditions for the synthesis of complex natural (alkaloids)
      and unnatural (fenestranes, phase transfer catalysts) nitrogen
      containing compounds. In recent years, his group has
      investigated the use of chemoinformatics to identify and
      optimize catalysts for a variety of organic and organometallic
      reactions.

  Professor Denmark has won a number of honors for both research and
  teaching.  These include: A. P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship, NSF
  Presidential Young Investigator Award, Stuart Pharmaceuticals Award,
  A. C. Cope Scholar Award (ACS), Alexander Von Humboldt Senior
  Scientist Award, Pedler Lecture and Medal (RSC), the ACS Award for

  Medal (RSC), the ISHC Senior Award in Heterocyclic Chemistry, Paul
  Karrer Lectureship (Uni Z&uuml;rich), the Frederic Stanley Kipping Award
  for Research in Silicon Chemistry (ACS), and the Harry and Carol
  Mosher Award (Santa Clara Section, ACS). He is a Fellow of the Royal
  Society of Chemistry and the American Chemical Society.  He has
  received numerous honorary lectureships and visiting professorships
  and has served on many editorial advisory boards. He edited Volume
  85 of <i>Organic Syntheses</i>, was Editor of Volumes 22-25 of <i>Topics in
  Stereochemistry</i> and was a founding Associate Editor of <i>Organic
  Letters</i> (1999-2004). After serving on the editorial board from
  1994-2003, he became Editor in Chief and President of <i>Organic
  Reactions, Inc.</i> in 2008.

      Pursuit of Treatments for Unmet Medical Needs: Current Approaches
      and Case Studies in Drug Discovery

      The current challenges faced by the pharmaceutical industry have
      been well-documented and extensively debated. Indeed, pharmaceutical
      drug discovery is a complicated endeavor. Fortunately, new discovery
      approaches are emerging to address these challenges. An overview of
      these drug discovery approaches along with specific case studies
      will be presented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Dustin J. Mergott received his Bachelor's degree in chemistry
      from Illinois Wesleyan University in 1998. He then received his
      Ph.D. in organic chemistry in 2004 from the University of Michigan
      under the guidance of Professor William R. Roush, and subsequently
      completed a two-year postdoctoral appointment at Harvard University
      in the lab of Professor Eric N. Jacobsen. Dustin joined Lilly in
      2006 where he is currently Principal Research Scientist and
      Medicinal Chemistry Group Leader. While at Lilly, Dustin’s research
      has focused on Alzheimer's Disease and Oncology. He has played a key
      role in leading Lilly's BACE inhibitor research program and is a
      named inventor on multiple U.S. patents covering BACE inhibitors.
      Dustin is a native of the midwest, having lived in Edina, Minnesota,
      where he was born, as well as Chicago, Ann Arbor, and now
      Indianapolis. He also loved his time in Cambridge, MA.

    <p>
      Tom received his undergraduate education in chemistry at Purdue
      University, a master’s degree from Central Michigan University,
      and his Ph.D. in physical organic chemistry from The Open
      University in England. Both Purdue and CMU have recognized Tom
      with their Distinguished Alumni Award for his contributions to
      science, education, and his community. Tom also received The
      Open University's highest recognition for his contributions to
      Education, the Arts, and the Sciences with an honorary doctorate
      degree, which was presented at a special ceremony in Versailles,
      France.
    </p>
    <p>
      He worked at the Dow Corning Corporation for 35 years where he
      achieved the highest scientific rank within the Corporation for
      his technical and leadership contributions. In addition, he
      holds academic positions in both the US and the UK. He is a
      Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, an American Chemical
      Society Fellow, a Sequoyah Fellow of the American Indian Science
      and Engineering Society, a Fellow of the Society for the
      Advancement of Hispanic/Chicanos &amp; Native Americans in Science
      and a number of other professional organizations. Tom was the
      elected president of the American Chemical Society (2009), and
      later joined the staff of Delta College as Chief Academic
      Officer and Vice President of Instruction and Learning Services.
      In retirement, Tom continues to focus his energies on STEM
      education and student success.
    </p>
    <p>
      For fun, Tom enjoys photography. He specializes in black &
      white film photography using large wooden field cameras (8x10
      inch negatives). He maintains a professional level darkroom in
      his home to develop and print his images using techniques and
      formulas that date back to the mid-1800.
