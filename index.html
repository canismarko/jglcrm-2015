	    Be Part of the Joint Great Lakes-Central Regional Meeting in
	    Grand Rapids!  It is now less than 3 months away&hellip;
	</h4>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>
	  As we get closer to the meeting date we seek your assistance
	  in the following ways:
	</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    In encouraging vendors with whom you have interactions to
	    agree to exhibit at the Meeting and to sponsor one or more
	    of our symposia or a social event. Visit
	    the <a href="/expo.html">expo page</a> for more
	    information
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    We could use at least 2 volunteers in the Layout of our
	    Program Book after abstracts have been submitted -
	    abstract submission opened January 2015
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    We will need help with the on-site physical registration
	    process as well.

	  Ionic liquids (ILs) are organic salts that have sufficiently
	  low melting points that, in their pure state, they are
	  liquid around room temperature. We will discuss how ILs can
	  be designed for a variety of important energy-related
	  applications. We will show ILs for gas separations,
	  including removal of CO<sub>2</sub> from post-combustion
	  flue gas, pre-combustion gases, and natural gas.
	</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      We will also discuss the use of ILs for two different types
      of refrigeration systems: IL/water absorption refrigeration
      and CO<sub>2</sub>/IL co-fluid vapor compression
      refrigeration.  Both of these offer environmental advantages
      over conventional technology while improving coefficients of
      performance.  Next, we will show how the structure of the
      anion and cation can improve the "ionicity" of ILs, which is
      important in the use of ILs as electrolytes for lithium-ion
      batteries, dye sensitized solar cells and supercapacitors.

	  The current challenges faced by the pharmaceutical industry
	  have been well-documented and extensively debated. Indeed,
	  pharmaceutical drug discovery is a complicated
