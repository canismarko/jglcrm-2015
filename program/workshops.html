      workshop are valuable to all members, whether you are in a formal
      leadership position or not. Members and non-members will be able to
      use these skills immediately in their work and school environments
      to better direct and manage projects, teams, committees.

    <h2>ACS Leadership Institute: Fostering Innovation</h2>
    <p>
      We are constantly challenged to come up with new ideas, approaches,
      and solutions, yet most of us feel ill- equipped to do this
      effectively. With a systematic and proven process to generate ideas
      you can lead your team to develop new ideas.  Gain the understanding
      and tools to tap into your own innovation style and stimulate
      innovative thinking among your team members.

  Industry Member Input Discussion with ACS President Diane Grob Schmidt</h2>
<p>
  ACS President Diane Grob Schmidt is interested in hosting a
  session at the 2015 Joint Great Lakes Central Regional Meeting to
  hear from industrial chemists on how the ACS could better serve
  their needs. Topics for discussion might include specific changes in
  education, safety training, understanding industrial goals and
  restrictions, publications, providing functions and facilities after
  graduation, etc.
</p>
<p>
  Those interested in attending and participating in one of these
  sessions should notify Diane
  at <a href="mailto:president@acs.org" title="Email Diane Grob Schmidt">
  president@acs.org</a>. Needed information is:
  <ul>
    <li>That you definitely plan to attend a session</li>
    <li>Areas on which you would like to see more focus.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>Details on when the session will be held are forthcoming.</p>

  Ethics Workshop</h2>
<p>To <strong>register for this workshop</strong>, please e-mail James Kiddle
  at <a href="mailto:james.kiddle@wmich.edu?subject=ethics workshop"
	title="E-mail James Kiddle">james.kiddle@wmich.edu</a>.
</p>
<h3>Susan M. Schelble</h3>
<h4>
  Metropolitan State University of Denver and Past
  Chair of ACS Ethics Education Subcommittee (2006-2014)</h4>
<h3>Barbara Moriarty</h3>
<h4>
  Past President of the Great Lakes Regional Meeting
  Steering Board</h4>
<p>
  The ethics workshop will be an interactive event. Typical ethical
  situations will be presented as Case Studies. These items have been
  developed from composites of reported ethical issues from a various
  jobs in the chemical profession. After each Case Study is presented,
  the workshop participants will be able to use clickers or smart
  device technology to vote on the predicted actual resolution of the
  issue (from a selection of multiple choice options). Often reality
  is not the best choice. The voting usually generates discussion
  about finding better resolution, or even how to prevent situations
  from accelerating out of control.
</p>
<p>
  Data will be collected on the views about common professional values
  embraced by members of ACS. There will be opportunities for
  participants to construct their own case scenarios and projected
  possible resolutions.
