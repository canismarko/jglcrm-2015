      We are constantly challenged to come up with new ideas, approaches,
      and solutions, yet most of us feel ill- equipped to do this
      effectively. With a systematic and proven process to generate ideas
      you can lead your team to develop new ideas.  Gain the understanding
      and tools to tap into your own innovation style and stimulate
      innovative thinking among your team members.

      <li>Fundamental risk assessment</li>

    <h3>&ldquo;Ask Dr. Safety&rdquo;</h3>
    <p>
      This symposium (Friday, May 29, 2015 9:00 a.m. until 10:30 a.m.)
      provides the attendees the opportunity to ask questions and discuss
      a broad chemical safety topic, such as chemical safety in the
      secondary school laboratory.  This session will explore perceptions
      and examine ways to solve challenges that secondary school chemical
      educators frequently face.
