      In today’s environment of shrinking hierarchies and increased
      reliance on individual contributors and teams, the skills in this

      We are constantly challenged to come up with new ideas, approaches,
      and solutions, yet most of us feel ill- equipped to do this
      effectively. With a systematic and proven process to generate ideas
      you can lead your team to develop new ideas.  Gain the understanding
      and tools to tap into your own innovation style and stimulate
      innovative thinking among your team members.
