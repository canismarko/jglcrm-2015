	<p>
	 Dr. Thomas B. Higgins is being recognized for his
	 unparalleled dedication to advancing diversity in the
	 chemical sciences and fostering activities to promote
	 inclusiveness in the region. As a professor at Harold
	 Washington community college in Chicago where 82% of student

	 the importance, challenges, and strategies of engaging
	 chemistry students in minority-serving
	 institutions. Dr. Higgins has made more than 70 local,
	 regional, and national conference presentations, and
	 organized 11 symposia and workshops designed to arm the
	 attendees with the skills necessary to best serve diverse

	<h4>Winner: Mary Barkley, Central Region</h4>
	<p>
	 Professor Mary Barkley's career is distinguished by an
	 extensive track record of promoting diversity in the
	 chemical sciences. She has worked to both promoting women
	 and minorities by leading formal committees and acting as
	 Department Chair of Chemistry, as well as by less-formal
	 mentoring efforts. Mary has chaired many committees to
	 address gender inequities. She was particularly pivotal to
	 securing CWRU's NSF ADVANCE grant that created a campus wide
	 program Academic Careers in Engineering and Science
	 (ACES). ACES is transforming the culture of the university
	 so that women want to be faculty in STEM fields. Mary had
	 substantial leadership roles in running the ACES program.
	 Mary was involved in formation of the Flora Stone Mather
	 Center for Women. Mary has served on the "To Tenure and
	 Beyond" workshops aimed at providing mentoring and advice
	 for junior women and minority faculty. Mary, as Chair of
	 Chemistry at CWRU, has promoted diversity and principles and
	 to change faculty attitudes towards diversity. Her efforts
	 has greatly increased diversity in the department, in recent
	 years included the hiring of many women and minority
	 faculty. Mary is actively coaching senior faculty to
	 understand issues surrounding diversity and to the needs of
	 junior faculty. The cumulative positive impact of her
	 efforts to increase diversity in the Chemical Sciences is
	 enormous and hard to calculate.

	<h4>Winner: Mr. Brad Portis, Gull Lake High School</h4>
	<p>
	  For the past 37 years, Brad has shared his love of chemistry
	  with students at Gull Lake High School.  His love of the subject
	  is obvious to his students as well as the high school principal,
	  Don Eastman.  Mr. Eastman stated that Brad consistently reaches
	  kids and motivates them to excel. &ldquo;He teaches the most
	  difficult class in the building, yet it is one of the most fun
	  and popular classes we offer.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p>
	  All students are given Brad’s cell phone number and encouraged
	  to call him at any reasonable time with homework questions.
	  Mr. Eastman said that he frequently hears from graduates and
	  their families that he teaches them how to study and how to be a
	  great student.  Former students report they were well prepared
	  for their college chemistry classes due to their solid chemistry
	  background from high school.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Mr. Portis is also very active in the community.  His students
	  are encouraged to volunteer at the ACS-sponsored Chemistry Day
	  at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum and they recently partnered with
	  the GLCS Kellogg Elementary Science Fair to enhance the science
	  learning culture.
	</p>
	<p>
	  His classes routinely participate and excel in the annual ACS
	  Competitive Exam for high school students, winning scholarship
	  money.  Between eight and fifteen Gull Lake students normally
	  advance from the preliminary exam to compete in the final exam.
	  A very high percentage of Brad’s students take the AP Chemistry
	  exam and often earn college credit based on their results.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Professional development is very important to Brad.  He attends
	  AP refresher courses to stay current and has also participated
	  in many opportunities presented by the Michigan Science Teachers
	  Association.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Mr. Eastman firmly believes that Brad is one of a kind and a
	  tremendous asset to their school community.

	<h4>Winner: Mr. Richard Samsa, Grove City High School</h4>
	<p>
	  I attended Mohawk Jr./Sr. High School and graduated as the
	  Salutatorian in 1980. Then I attended Youngstown State
	  University where I graduated Cum Laude in 1984. Since then,
	  I have been teaching Chemistry for 30 years in two
	  Pennsylvania schools. I began my teaching career at
	  Purchase Line Jr./Sr. High School where I taught Physics,
	  Applied Chemistry, General Chemistry and Advanced Chemistry
	  for one and a half years. I was also the head Jr. High
	  basketball coach. From there I moved to Grove City High
	  School where I have taught General Chemistry and Advanced
	  Chemistry (which later became AP Chemistry) for 28
	  years. This year I am also teaching one Principles of
	  Science class to freshmen at our high school. I have been a
	  7th-grade, Junior-Varsity, and Varsity Assistant Boy’s
	  Basketball coach throughout many of those years. I have
	  also been the advisor for Students For Life, Fellowship of
	  Christian Athletes, and the Bible Club throughout those
	  years. I have published two articles in the Journal of
	  Chemical Education and have presented demonstrations in
	  four different high school and college settings. I am in
	  the process of writing two additional articles that will
	  hopefully be published in the next couple of years.
	</p>
	<p>
	  As a teacher my accomplishments are derived from my
	  students’ accomplishments. I am happy and proud to have
	  been a part of the chemical education of four students
	  who have gone on to achieve Ph..D’s in Chemistry, at
	  least six students who have become High-School Chemistry
	  teacher, and also been involved in the education of many
	  students who have gone on to become medical doctors. My
	  students have also achieved the top two scores in our
	  local section (the Penn-Ohio Border Section) of the
	  American Chemical Society for the past ten years. I was
	  also privileged to be the Baccalaureate speaker at my
	  high school alma mater three years ago.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I am also heavily involved in the music ministry for the
	  Grove City Alliance Church as well as a folk-rock band
	  (Treebeard Brown ) composed of teachers from our high
	  school. I have written many songs and am currently playing
	  some solo venues as well as with the bands. I live with my
	  wife Becky and dog Sheba in Grove City where we have
	  resided for 28 years. I thank God for the abilities He has
	  given me and for putting in a place where my personality
	  and skills fit a tremendous student population.

	<p>
	  Marya Lieberman earned her BS degree in chemistry at the

	  in Seattle, earning the PhD in 1994.  She received an NSF
	  Postdoctoral Fellowship for work in surface chemistry at
	  Caltech with Nathan Lewis.  She is currently an associate
	  professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at
	  the University of Notre Dame, where she likes to knit tiny
	  potholders out of DNA and cut messages into molecular films
	  using a 2 nm electron beam as a lawnmower.  About four years
	  ago, she became interested in the constraints of carrying
	  out chemical analysis in low resource settings and devised a
	  lab-on-paper system to speed up the detection of low quality
	  and fake medicines. These paper test cards are being used to
	  screen hundreds of medications in Kenya and other developing
	  countries.  Fast field tests like these are a concrete step
