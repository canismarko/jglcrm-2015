      The 2015 JGLCRM Regional ACS meeting will likely draw 1000&ndash;1400
      contacts and potential new customers from a wide range of
      industries. At the meeting, there will be an exhibition space to
      display your company’s unique products and interact with the meeting
      attendees. The exhibition is scheduled in four sessions over two days,
      including hours unopposed by the technical programs or social
      events. The exhibition area is centrally located with respect to
      technical meeting rooms, plenary session areas, poster session areas
      and registration, thus ensuring strong traffic flow through the
      exhibits. A series of raffle and other events are planned during the
      exhibition. If you have any special items you would like to donate for
      raffle events or if your company would be interested in sponsoring a
      refreshment break, poster session, social event, awards or plenary
      session, we would appreciate your support and will prominently
      recognize your participation.

  replenished. Unused literature will not be returned unless special
  arrangements are made.

  high school attendance day, and tables will be available at a
  reduced rate.
